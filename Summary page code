#SUMMARY PAGE
#The user will be shown a visual representation of the summary of their order as a bar graph,
#showing the items bought by the customer and the respective quantities. This part of the
#program utilises the pandas library to create a data frame from a dictionary comprising of
#lists created early in the program. The order details will be stored as a csv file in the system,
#which is used to plot the summary graph
