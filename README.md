# Small Basket
Created a e-commerce program using python


The aim of Small Basket, our simple shopping cart program, is to allow users to choose items
from a list of groceries and buy them.
The program contains four categories/groups of groceries: Fruits, Vegetables, Chips, Bakery.
A user can select items from any of the categories and may purchase those items.
Users can:
1. View and select all available items
2. Add wanted items to a cart
3. See a copy of the bill
4. See their order summary in the form of a graph

MODULES REQUIRED IN PYTHON:
• TKINTER: Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter
provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented
interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
• MATPLOTLIB: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive
visualizations in Python.
• PANDAS(DATAFRAME): Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes
McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame.
DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of
variables.
• PILLOW(PIL): The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python
interpreter.
CODE FOR IMPORTING MODULES:
import tkinter as tk
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from PIL import Image, ImageTk 

FUTURE EXTENSIONS
This project is just a prototype and cannot be used in the real word. We were required to
complete this project within a given time frame and hence were not able to enhance it.
However, by making the required and necessary changes, this program can be used in the real
world. Our plans for future extensions are:
1. Integrate user login code
2. To reduce the length of the code by using more iterative statements.
3. To make the code more user friendly (by improving the interface) by using more widgets
and functions.
4. This code can be made more efficient with the help of machine learning as the user can
get recommendations according to his/her preferences.
5. Increasing the scope, i.e. adding a greater number of items.
6. Adding more features such as delivery of the grocery items, discounts, and active
tracking of the delivery items.


CONCLUSION
Small Basket was built using Python and its various modules. This gave us an opportunity to
explore the vast world of python outside the scope of the textbook as well allowing us to learn
a wide range of programs that can be made using python. We went through many ups and
downs while making this code, which in the end us taught us to be patient and resilient.
